# Sorting Algorithms in JavaScript

This folder contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in JavaScript, each designed to help you understand and master the fundamentals of sorting techniques.

## Sorting Techniques Included

1. **Bubble Sort**  
   A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. **Selection Sort**  
   An in-place comparison sort where the list is divided into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted section. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.

3. **Insertion Sort**  
   Builds the sorted array one item at a time, picking the next item from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part.

4. **Merge Sort**  
   A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

5. **Quick Sort**  
   Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays based on whether elements are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

## How to Use

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file with clear comments explaining the logic. To run any sorting algorithm:
