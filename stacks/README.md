# Stacks in Data Structures

Welcome to the **Stacks** section of the **DSA with JavaScript** repository! This folder contains various implementations and problem-solving examples involving **stacks**, a fundamental data structure in computer science.

## What is a Stack?

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates: you add new plates to the top, and you also take them off from the top.

### Key Operations

1. **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
3. **Peek**: Retrieve the top element without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Check whether the stack is empty or not.

Stacks are widely used in various algorithms, including those for parsing expressions, backtracking problems, and depth-first search (DFS) in graph traversal.

## Files in This Folder

### 1. `reverseOrder.js`

This JavaScriptScriptScript file demonstrates how to reverse the order of words in a string using a stack. We split the string into individual words, push them into a stack, and then pop them out in reverse order.

- **Key Concepts**: String manipulation, stack-based reversal.
- **Usage**: Reversing the order of words in any given string.

### 2. `stackImplementation.js`

This file contains a basic **stack implementation** in JavaScriptScript. It demonstrates how to manually implement a stack with key operations like `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()`.

- **Key Concepts**: Stack implementation from scratch.
- **Usage**: Understanding the internal workings of a stack and how to apply its operations.

### 3. `validParanthesis.js`

This file contains a solution for checking whether a given string of parentheses (`()[]{}`) is valid using a stack. Itâ€™s a popular problem that demonstrates how stacks can be used for matching parentheses in expressions.

- **Key Concepts**: Matching parentheses, stack usage for balanced expressions.
- **Usage**: Useful in compilers, interpreters, and solving expression-related problems.
