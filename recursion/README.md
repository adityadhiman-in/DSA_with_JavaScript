# Recursion in JavaScript

This folder contains a collection of recursive algorithms and examples implemented in JavaScript.

## How Recursion Works

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. The function continues to call itself with modified arguments until it reaches a specific stopping condition, known as the base case.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Base Case**: The condition under which the recursion terminates. It prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely and causes the function to return a result.

2. **Recursive Case**: The part of the function where it calls itself with new arguments, moving towards the base case.

### Why Use Recursion?

- **Simplifies Complex Problems**: Recursion can break down complex problems into simpler, more manageable sub-problems.
- **Cleaner Code**: Certain problems, such as tree traversal and factorial calculation, are more naturally expressed with recursion, leading to more readable code.
- **Elegant Solutions**: Recursive solutions can be more elegant and concise compared to iterative ones.

### When to Avoid Recursion

- **Performance Considerations**: Recursive functions can be less efficient in terms of memory usage due to the overhead of multiple function calls and the use of the call stack.
- **Potential for Stack Overflow**: If the base case is not defined correctly or the recursion depth is too large, it can lead to a stack overflow error.
